üßæ Project Title
Personalized Starter Website Platform

üìå Project Description
This full-stack website serves as a starter template generator and editor for users to create, edit, and personalize their own web pages. It allows users to generate a template with default components (e.g., hero section, about, contact) and then customize content and layout through a friendly front-end interface.

All user data will be stored locally in the browser (via LocalStorage) for instant prototyping and optionally persisted to a backend server via a user account system. Users can preview and export their custom sites as downloadable HTML/CSS/JS files or publish them live (optional advanced feature).
